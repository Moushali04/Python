# Python
This repository contains a collection of my Python projects, showcasing various applications and scripts I've developed. It includes a variety of Python files for different use cases, ranging from simple scripts to more complex applications.

Machine Learning Regression Models
This project is a hands-on exploration of different regression models in machine learning. The goal is to understand how each model works and how well it can predict continuous values like prices, scores, or trends.

I’ve implemented and compared several popular regression algorithms to see how they perform on various datasets. It’s a great starting point for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of regression techniques.

What’s Included:
A variety of regression models:
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Polynomial Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Data preprocessing and feature scaling
Visualizations to interpret model behavior and predictions
Model evaluation using metrics like R² score, RMSE, and MAE

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas and NumPy
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

Datasets:
This project uses publicly available datasets from sources such as Kaggle and Scikit-learn.
